## Getting Started
This is a React application that dynamically renders a table based on data fetched from a user-provided API URL. The table automatically detects columns and includes sorting, and pagination features.


## Technology used
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project developed with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Here we have used some third-party npm packages which are tracable through package.json file.

## How to run this application?

First, download or clone the files using following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhendu-baral/dynamic-api-table-fetch.git

```

Then install all the npm Dependencies using following command:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Now you can Start Development Server using following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deployment
The application is deployed on Vercel.
